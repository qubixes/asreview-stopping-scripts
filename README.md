# asreview-stopping-scripts [Obselete and out-dated]

Scripts to compute stopping criteria

### powertail.py

Should be obselete, copy in asreview-simulation

### download.py

Some scripts to download datasets and create optimization files. Should be at least half obselete.
Some of it is copied in asreview-simulation, but I'm not sure if everything is, or how well it works.

### pres_plot.py

Some scripts to make nice plots for a presentation. Could be used in the future for the visualization
package.

### error_sim.py

Script to simulate the inclusion estimation.
